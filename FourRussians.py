"""

This module is an implementation of the Four Russians Algorithm for
matrix multiplication and complementary graph.

One of the main requirements was to implement this algorith without
using any external libraries (use only built in libraries).


Algorithm Description:

The main idea of the method is to partition the matrix into small square
blocks of size t Ã— t for some parameter t, and to use a lookup table to
perform the algorithm quickly within each block.
The index into the lookup table encodes the values of the matrix cells
on the upper left of the block boundary prior to some operation of the
algorithm, and the result of the lookup table encodes the values of the
boundary cells on the lower right of the block after the operation.
Thus, the overall algorithm may be performed by operating on only (n/t)^2
blocks instead of on n^2 matrix cells, where n is the side length
of the matrix. In order to keep the size of the lookup tables
(and the time needed to initialize them) sufficiently small,
t is typically chosen to be O(log n).

PEP 8 Style is being used for this module.
